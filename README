The Steam protocol plugin for bitlbee. This plugin uses the Steam Mobile
API allowing it to run alongside the main Steam client. It is worth
noting that the Steam Mobile API is HTTP based, which does lead to mild
latency.

Building and Installing:
  Make sure bitlbee and its headers have been installed. If bitlbee came
  from the distribution's repository, it will most likely need the
  development package, usually bitlbee-dev.

  If bitlbee was built by hand (or alike via a script), ensure the make
  target `install-dev` is invoked. This target is not called by default,
  and will install the headers that are needed.

  Do *not* use the source tree headers unless you know what you are
  doing. This can lead to mismatched header versions, which often times
  will lead to bad things.

  $ git clone https://github.com/jgeboski/bitlbee-steam.git
  $ cd bitlbee-steam

  With a "global" (or system) bitlbee installation:

  $ ./autogen.sh
  $ make
  $ make install

  Or with a "local" bitlbee installation (location: $HOME/bitlbee):

  $ export BITLBEE_CFLAGS="-I$HOME/bitlbee/include/bitlbee"
  $ export BITLBEE_LIBS=""
  $ ./autogen.sh --libdir=$HOME/bitlbee/lib
  $ make
  $ make install
